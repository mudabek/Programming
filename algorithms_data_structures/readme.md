# Algorithms and Data Structures
#### Short Information
This repository contains programs implementing various algorithms

#### List of all topics covered
+ sorting (quadratic sorts, merge sort, quick sort, counting sort, digit sort)
+ search algorithms (binary search, ternary search, interpolational search)
+ data structures (linked list, dynamic array, stack, queue, priority queue, heap and heapsort)
+ hash tables (collision problem, chaining, open addressing, Bloom's filter)
+ dynamic programming
+ segment calculations (prefix sums, sparse table, Fenwick tree)
+ search trees (binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, 2-3 tree, splay, TreeSet, TreeMap, Descartes tree, random priorities, hidden key)
+ graphs (DFS, BFS, cycles, topo sort, graph condensation, bridges, Djikstra, Ford-Bellman, Floyd, minimum spanning tree, Kruskal, Prim, flows)
+ algorithms on strings (polynomial hashing, prefix function, z-function, Bor)
+ grammar and parsing (languages, formal grammar, LL(1), LL(k), recursive descent)
+ geometry (points, vectors, line intersection, shape detection, area of polygon, point inside polygon)
