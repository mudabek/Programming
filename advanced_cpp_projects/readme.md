# Advanced C++
#### Short information:
This repository contains C++ projects I made during the Advanced C++ course I took as a part of Mail.ru Group Machine Learning Academy 

#### List of topics:
+ compiler, assembler
+ memory in C++
+ function, structs, classes, virtual functions
+ classes, inheritance, polymorphism
+ templates, exceptions
+ allocators
+ STL containers, iterators
+ smart pointers
+ metaprogramming, compile-time calculations

#### Overview of folders/branches:
+ count_determinant_assembly - small program written in assembly language for computing determinant of a 3x3 matrix
+ custom_chunk_allocator - custom allocator implementing chunk allocation of a memory
+ double_classifier - program to identify the type of double (NaN, real, etc.)
+ function_compose - program that composes many function into one in an elegant manner
+ geometry - big program that uses main concepts of object oriented programming (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism) to manipulate geometric objects and run diffent geometric calculations
+ list - big project recreating all of the STL's list functionalities
+ matrix - program for working with matrices
+ smart_pointers - program recreating all of the STL's smart pointers (weak pointer, unique pointer, shared pointer) functionalities
+ vector_operatios - program for working with mathematical vectors
